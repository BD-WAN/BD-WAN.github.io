# Encryption

Usually there is a tradeoff between security and speed. The traditional argument is that hardware encryption (expensive & more secure) is better than Software encryption (cheap & less secure). BaaT offers the best of both - leveraging **Network Function Virtualization** (NFV) architecture and Blockchain technology to deliver encryption that is more secure than hardware based and as inexpensive as software based.

The further down the OSI model you go – the more control you can have of the security and efficiency of the encryption. For example, IPSEC along with other layer 3 encryption methodologies lose 50% to 70% of their bandwidth and speed performance. **BaaT** encryption is focused to encrypt packets down to layer 2 encryption and can achieve 80% more bandwidth efficiency than other encryption solutions.

Any layer 2 or layer 3 traffic passing thru a BaaT Secure Data Pipeline is fully encrypted leveraging three distinct security methods:
- Transport Layer Security via **Blockchain SHA-256** – Secure Hash Algorithm
- Data Packet Encryption via **AES-256** – Advanced Encryption Standard
- Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization - **(PQCS)** realized via – BaaT Encryption’s approach to **QRNG**, **QKD** and **QRA**.

The combination of the above three methods (SHA-256, AES-256, PQCS) ensures that neither the endpoints (source/destination) or the data payload can be penetrated or compromised. Encrypted Data Pipelines can be deployed in Point-to-point, Multi-Point, Hub and spoke, Fully meshed topologies.
