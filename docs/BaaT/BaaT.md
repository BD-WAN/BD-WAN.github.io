# Blockchain as a Transport
{: .mt-6 .fs-5 .fw-300} 
{: .no_toc }

Blockchain as a Transport is our overlay and security system. BaaT is an advanced L2VPN solution for both enterprises and telco/service providers, with which the organization can leverage the public Internet for their WAN traffic so that they donâ€™t need to share traffic with their upstream providers as in the case of MPLS VPN service or even modern SD-WAN.

Unlike  other  tunneling  techniques,  BaaT  is  built  to  operate  in  a  multipoint  fashion.Its signaling is done separately via theblockchain and it has no scalability issues.

BaaT is a flexible Overlay solution. We are using **VXLAN** protocol. But we also can use:
- GRE 
- GENEVE
- STT
- LISP

But it is also a very secured solution. It is protected by Quantum Resistant encryption algorythms. Which makes our solution *Military Grade*. Now we can switch to the next topic - [Security](https://bd-wan.github.io//docs/BaaT/Encryption/).
