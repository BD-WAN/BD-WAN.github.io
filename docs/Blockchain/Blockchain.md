BD-WAN is based on the well-known Software-Defined WAN(SD-WAN) architecture butwith lots of fine tuning and blockchain engagement as will be detailed.Enterprise network    operatorsare    demanding    moreflexible,    open,    and    cloud-based WANtechnologies, rather than installing specialized WAN technology that involve expensivefixed circuitsandproprietary  hardware.

They  question  whether  their  high-priced  MPLS  and  point-to-point  connections  are  really  necessary,  and  how  much  of  their  application  traffic  can  be  safely offloaded to the public Internet. They also question whether there are more “plug-and-play” WAN solutions  for  their  branch  offices  that  do  not  require  truck  rolls  to  install  WAN  edge  gear  and complex QOS and security configuration to manage traffic across the WAN.
