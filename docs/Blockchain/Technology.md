# Technology

Our technology is a new approach. New approach, in terms of adapting blockchain abilities along with SD-WAN power to serve for telecomunication industry. It might be not that clear for now, but you will be encouraged as you get it! Let's get started!

## SD-WAN approach
{: .mt-7}
Few words about SD-WAN, what's it, and how it helps us?
{: .mt-3 .fs-5 .fw-300}
> *Software-defined wide-area networking (SD-WAN) is an automated, programmatic approach to managing enterprise network connectivity and circuit costs. It extends software-defined networking (SDN) into an application that businesses can use to quickly create a smart hybrid WAN.*
{: .mt-6 .fs-5 .fw-300}
In few words, less work, more profit! Love it! But... Everything is not that "great" as we would want it. Throughput, encryption, overhead, sometimes expensive private circuits are still required to communicate with the SD-WAN controller, it can be thousands of tunnels you might need. Cloud based Controller might be inappropriate in closed networks with no internet connection. Private network bring in some new problems, such as a server you have to maintaine and etc.

## What is Blockchain and why?
{: .mt-7}
We are used to hear about blockchains and cryptocurrencies going along together. We are not offering you the old model. We make it simple and effective.
{: .mt-6 .fs-5 .fw-300}
> *A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.*
{: .mt-6 .fs-5 .fw-300}
That's it! That's the whole point of our intention to use the blockchain. To spread control plane data across the nodes. If you want to communicate with any device, why would you use a third person(a controller)? Why wouldn't you communicate directly? That's where the Blockchain can help us!

Something catchy is needed here

Now, with an understanding of What and Why we can move to [Architecture](https://bd-wan.github.io//docs/Blockchain/Architecture/) topic to undestand how everything is tighen together!
