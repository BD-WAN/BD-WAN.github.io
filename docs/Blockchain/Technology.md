# Technology

Our Technology is a new approach. New approach, in terms of adapting blockchain abilities along with SD-WAN power to serve for telecomunication industry. It might be not that clear for now, but you will be encouraged as you get it! Let's get started!

## What is blockchain for us?
{: .mt-7}
We are used to hear about blockchains and cryptocurrencies going along together. We are not offering you the old model. We make it simple.

> *A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.*
{: .mt-6 .fs-5 .fw-300}
That's it! That's the whole point of our intention to use the blockchain. To spread particular data across the network. If you want to communicate with any device, why would you use a third person as a controller? Why wouldn't you communicate directly? That's where the Blockchain can help us!

We are not builind thousands of sockets to comunicate with each other, we do not rely on a single point of failure as a controller. No need in backing up the database and being scared of your server will get offline, be shuted down, be blocked, have some routing issue... Anything can happen!
