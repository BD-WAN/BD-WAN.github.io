# CrossChain Universe

**CrossChain** is our future vision for **BD-WAN**. It allows infinity amount of chains being able to communicate and talk to each other. You could share your data with different **BD-WAN** domains. For example **ISP 1** and **ISP 2** are using different local **BD-WAN** domains. If **ISP 1** wants to share routing information and easily establish secured tunnel over *Internet*, he just can pass some data in **CrossChain**. Both sides have to have an agreement regarding security rules, consensus and other preferences that would protect this awesome feature. You don't have to add any nodes from **ISP 2** domain to pass data there, what makes the **CrossChain** simple to deploy and use.

## Polkadot
[Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/) works with [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

> *Polkadot unites and secures a growing ecosystem of specialized blockchains called parachains. Apps and services on Polkadot can securely communicate across chains, forming the basis for a truly interoperable decentralized web.*
