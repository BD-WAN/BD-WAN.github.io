# CrossChain Universe

**CrossChain** is our future vision for **BD-WAN**. It allows infinity amount of chains being able to communicate and share data with each other. You can share your data with different **BD-WAN** domains.

For example **ISP 1** and **ISP 2** are using different local **BD-WAN** domains. If **ISP 1** wants to share routing information and easily establish secured tunnel over *Internet*, he just can pass some data in **CrossChain**. Both sides have to have an agreement regarding security rules, consensus and other preferences that would protect this awesome feature. You don't have to add any nodes from **ISP 2** domain to pass data there, what makes the **CrossChain** simple to deploy and use.

## Polkadot
[Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/) works with [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

> *Polkadot unites and secures a growing ecosystem of specialized blockchains called parachains. Apps and services on Polkadot can securely communicate across chains, forming the basis for a truly interoperable decentralized web.*

**Key Points:**
- Polkadot is a layer-0 protocol and multichain network laying the foundation for the future of Web3. Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.
- Substrate allows you to create specialized blockchains for any use case, and was used by Parity Technologies to create Polkadot itself, which attests to its high level of performance, flexibility, and robustness.
- While Substrate can be used to build any type of blockchain, not just Polkadot parachains, connecting to Polkadot offers a multitude of benefits, including built-in security, cross-chain interoperability, and access to Polkadotâ€™s growing ecosystem of platforms, applications, and end-users.
- Building a custom blockchain with Substrate offers greater freedom, flexibility, and optimization than building on top of a general-purpose smart-contract blockchain.
