# BD-WAN Controlerless approach

In fact, BD-WAN is the first world serverless SD-WAN concept. We do our topology flat and simple. We don't have a Controller, but you can assume that every BD-WAN node has Controller attributes. You can manage your Blockchain domain from any BD-WAN node you are able to interact with, but you have to have a Key for that. So as you can see, you don't have any single point of control anymore. You can controll your network directly from anywhere theoretically, especially if you are using BaaT encrypted channel. Which makes your traffic *invisible* in the Internet. But we will get more familiar with BaaT [here](https://bd-wan.github.io//docs/BaaT).
