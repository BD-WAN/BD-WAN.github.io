# Overview

**Blockchain-Defined Wide Area Networks** (BD-WAN): **BD-WAN** integrates blockchain with Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) for a secure, scalable virtualization of WAN transport technologies. Among the unique features (not available with most SD-WAN architectures):

- The ability to dynamically establish and tear down logical and physical circuits so customers pay only for what they consume.

- Inter-Domain MPLS Traffic Engineering via blockchain (near zero time delay).

- Trusted per-usage billings that are verified and hard-coded over the blockchain.

- Full visibility and control over all transport facilities either via Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) or via partnership with key telco operators and metro Ethernet providers worldwide. 

- Bringing public cloud and content services seamlessly to the customers' doorstep as part of the standard offering.
