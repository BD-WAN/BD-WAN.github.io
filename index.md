- Serverless SD-WAN concept.

- Smart and efficient adoption of Blockchain for telco industry.

- Quantum resistant level of encryption.

- The ability to dynamically establish and tear down logical and physical circuits so customers pay only for what they consume.

- Trusted per-usage billings that are verified and hard-coded over the blockchain.

- Carrier agnostic. 

- No more expensive private cirucuits are needed.

[BD-WAN](https://bd-wan.github.io//docs/BD-WAN) is a step ahead in Software Defined networks approach. Our main goals are security and ease-of-use. We offer a reliable solution, with a fresh view on important sides of the technology. Blockchain brings in the uniqueness, by leveraging the complexity of SD-WAN on it's shoulders.
